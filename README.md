# Programmable-Logic-Array
This is a C++ implementation of Programmable Logic Array.
**LOGIC:**
1) Quine McCluskey Method is used for the minimization of functions.
2) Set in STL C++ is used to find the union of minterms of a possible combination of functions.
3) The set with minimum size gives the selected functions.
